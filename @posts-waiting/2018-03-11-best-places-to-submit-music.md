Many artists will relate to what I am about to say:

Getting exposure for your music is _INCREDIBLY_ difficult to do.

Or is it?

Actually, you can free exposure for your music very easily. All it takes is a little searching.

We've done that hard work for you and compiled this list of many incredibly easy ways to submit your music and potentially make your huge break!

## Strategy for Submitting Your Music
Many times your music will actually be up there in terms of quality with the big artists. All that's really left to do is get it in front of the right people. Blogs and other submission platforms are easy, cost-effective (and sometimes free!) ways of doing this. Really, and all you have to do to get to their level is to submit your music to the right people?

Yes!

We will admit, though, it can be confusing with all these blogs and platforms as some of them are pretty low quality and you'll just end up wasting your time. Valuable hours can be lost this way.

Even if you find the right person to send it to, they may not be looking for your email. Sometimes, even popular blogs have a specific way that they accept submissions. So even if you find the right person to send it to, you may never get a response from them!

You've come to the right place because we're going to show you exactly which places you can submit your music for a good shot at getting your records in front of a lot of people.

## 1. Submitting Your Music To Blogs
Music blogs are some of the beset places to discover new artists and gain credibility in the industry. Here are some good music blogs you can submit your music to
* [Dancing Astronaut](https://dancingastronaut.com/)
* [YourEDM](https://www.youredm.com/)
* [Nest HQ](https://nesthq.com/)
* and of course our own [music blog submission](https://soundgrail.com/promotion/music-blog-feature/) page on SoundGrail.

You can either personally reach out to a blogger or you can use a service like Submithub. Let's talk about that next.

## 2. Using Submithub
This handy web platform lets you submit your music to labels, blogs, and playlists for a chance to get signed, reviewed, or included in a playlist.

Depending on which you want to do, you may be required to submit a released track or an unreleased track.

This platforms is very user-friendly and has simplified the process of submitting music to blogs and labels.

Each channel (which can be a blog, label, etc) has their own page with a link to submit.

Basically, you get two credits every day for free or you can buy "Premium Credits" for one dollar each. Some channels only accept premium credits while others accept all kinds. Premium credits generally increase your chance of exposure and acceptance. You can head over to [Submithub](https://www.submithub.com/) and try it out!

## 3. Get Your Music on Spotify Playlists
Most labels and blogs have submission forms where you can submit your music to be added to their Spotify playlists. These playlists can have thousands and even hundreds of thousands of listeners.

To find these submission forms, you need to do some digging around, especially on Instagram. Let us give you an example.

If your music is good enough, you'll find yourself placed on some playlists and you'll ideally be able to make your way into some bigger, better, and badder playlists.

All in all, getting on Spotify playlists is a a great way to get some good exposure and we invite you [submit music to Spotify playlists](https://soundgrail.com/promotion/spotify-playlist/) that we own here at Soundgrail.

## 4. SoundCloud Repost Networks
This is the process of getting your song reposted by other channels, which may also include other artists, but it is usually used to refer to labels, networks, and the rest.

You can submit a form to have your music [reposted on SoundCloud](https://soundgrail.com/promotion/soundcloud-repost/) by our channels.

You can send your track to some repost groups you find on SoundCloud and, depending on the size, you may be able to get reposts for free, although some networks and channels will charge you.

It's also a good idea to start your own network with your friends. This is the best way to grow together and help each other out along the way.

## 5. Submit Your Music to Podcasts and Radio Shows
Many artists and labels have their own radio shows where they invite other artists to mix 30 - 60 minute sets. You can get on these mixes! Just reach out to the channels and see what happens.

Many producers have used this road to reach a bigger audience with their music. Sometimes they also secured a release with that same record label afterward!

Here are some of our favorite radio shows

* [Noisia Radio](https://soundcloud.com/noisiaradio)
* [Hexagon Radio](https://www.dondiablo.com/hexagonradio)

## Make Good Quality Music
All in all, we or anyone else on the internet can spit endless advice about who to submit to, how to do it, when to do it, and more. We could give you endless amounts of coaching and give you email templates that are proven to get the attention of an A&R representative. However, this will all be a waste of your time if you don't have good music. Seriously.

Before you ever even begin to think about which blogs to submit to and capture the attention of an A&R manager, you need to have professional music to showcase. Looking at your music objectively is very difficult and it's a very rare skill to have and be able to do it well. But all of the professionals do it.

You need to make sure that your music is on par with the producers that you look up to. The artists that are killing it right now hold themselves to a very high standard. Why should you be any different? It's a hard reality to face and those that don't will simply waste their time trying endless 'proven' methods of submitting their music and end up angry that they don't get a response.

Anyone that you send your music too, whether it be A&Rs, managers, blogs, or labels, will be able to distinguish a professional track within 5 seconds. Think about how many times you've been searching on SoundCloud and spotify and only gave a song five seconds--or even less. You're not the only one.

The rate that you get emails back is directly proportional to the quality of your music. There's no way to stand out in the white noise than to simply be better than the white noise.

If your music is not quite up to par yet, as we discussed earlier, don't waste your time sending it out. First impressions are crucial and getting a bad rep for your name is the worst thing that you can do to yourself.

It will be much more worth your while to use your time effectively to improve your production.

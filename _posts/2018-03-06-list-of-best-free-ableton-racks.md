I'm sure you've experienced this before:

Wishing you had all the hot new VSTs everyone seems to be talking about.

But how can one possibly get _all_ of these plugins? They cost so much money and it seems impossible for a new producer to cough up thousands of dollars for these plugins.

But there's another way.

In reality, you can get tons of free instruments and effects without spending a dime...

...this often overlooked gem in Ableton: Effect Racks.

This is made possible by Ableton's awesome community of producers that make amazing plugins for the world to use. These producers are literally giving their secrets away--for free!


So, with that, if you’re looking for the best free Ableton effect racks, you've come to the right place! The SoundGrail team has compiled a list of the best free Ableton racks for your convenience. You'll see a few gems, namely Bass Kleph's Easy Wash Out

This is everything you need to make your next hit!


## 1. Bass Kleph's Easy Washout
Perhaps the most widely known effect rack to date is the Easy Washout by Bass Kleph. It's the perfect rack for creating amazing buildups and you can also use it for transitions between sections too.

{% include /helpers/blog-blockquote.html quote="Watch the video below, or read on....This is a plugin to simplify buildups in music production. It has one knob. You turn it and it does many things at once. Mainly, it washes things out. It gradually applies a high pass filter, reverb, grain delay, filter delay, compression, and few other things. On top of this, when you have the knob on zero, it bypasses all these effects to keep your signal path clean, and CPU light. As soon as you start to turn it, it engages the plugins. This thing is an Ableton macro plugin, made from standard built in, Ableton Live plugins." author="Bass Kleph" %}

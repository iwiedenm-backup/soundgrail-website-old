Iâ€™m an enthusiastic software engineer currently shaping the future of social media automation, while traveling around the world as a musician.

I've spent the last few years helping various companies optimize the delivery of their services and digital products as well as to enhance their online experience and web presence. This experience together with freelance work I've done, allowed me to acquire wide range of skills as a software developer and social media expert.
